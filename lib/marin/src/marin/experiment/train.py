"""A generic language-model training assembler.

:func:`train_lm` turns the *meaningful* decisions of a training run — the model, the
optimizer, the data, the token budget, the regularization, the evals — into a lazy
``ArtifactStep[LevanterCheckpoint]``. Every one of those is a required argument:
the helper defaults none of them, so reading the call shows the whole experiment. What
it *does* own is the mechanical marin-on-TPU plumbing that is identical across runs and
carries no experiment meaning: the data-parallel mesh and token ``compute_mapping``,
the rolling resumption checkpointer, the eval-harness wiring, the WandB replication
path, and the Fray dispatch of the training job. That split is this design's
identity-vs-execution line — *what is computed* is the caller's, *how/where it runs* is
the library's.

This is deliberately **not** a ``default_train``: it bakes in no optimizer, no mixture,
no default eval suite, no learning rate. It only removes boilerplate.

    The required arguments are the run's identity-bearing decisions; the helper defaults
    none of them. ``datasets`` maps each tokenized-dataset handle to its mixture weight,
    and ``validation`` lists handles to add at weight 0; ``train_lm`` assembles the
    :func:`~marin.experiment.data.mixture` internally and derives the step's deps from
    those handles, so they materialize first and the data config cannot desync from the
    dependencies. ``evals=None`` opts out of harness evals explicitly — there is no
    implicit default suite.

    The remaining parameters are execution choices that do not define the experiment:
    ``mp`` (the standard marin precision, identity-bearing but universal),
    ``tensor_parallel_size`` (model sharding width), eval/checkpoint cadence, tracker
    metadata, and ``resources`` (the TPU the job is dispatched onto — a runtime arg, so it
    never enters the checkpoint's fingerprint). ``init_from`` chains this run onto another
    checkpoint (it becomes a dep and seeds ``initialize_from_checkpoint_path``).

    Training length is set by exactly one of ``num_train_steps`` or ``num_train_epochs`` (setting
    both, or neither, is an error). ``num_train_epochs`` is a thin convenience over
    ``num_train_steps``: it resolves to ``ceil(num_train_epochs * num_train_tokens / (seq_len *
    batch_size))`` from the training cache's token total, which counts packed sequences rather than
    raw documents — the correct measure for packed SFT, where a hand-computed step count over raw
    documents can be several times too long. Epoch semantics are only defined for a single training
    dataset; pass ``num_train_steps`` directly for a mixture.

    A mutable (``dev``) ``version`` namespaces the checkpoint per user — its name becomes
    ``users/{username}/{name}`` so concurrent authors of the same experiment do not clobber each
    other; a fixed (calendar) ``version`` keeps the shared name. ``version`` defers to the ambient
    :class:`~marin.execution.build_context.BuildContext` when omitted (resolved by ``name`` before
    the per-user namespacing), so a driver can set it once for the whole run via
    :mod:`marin.experiment.cli`.
