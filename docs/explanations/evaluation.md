# Evaluation Overview

This document explains how Marin evaluates models and where to find runnable workflows.

For step-by-step usage, start with:

- [Running Evaluations with Marin](../tutorials/run-lm-evals.md) for command lines covering
  Evalchemy and Harbor across registered models.
- [Harbor Framework Integration](../harbor-integration.md) for Harbor dataset, agent, endpoint, and
  result details.

## Evaluation modes

Marin supports three evaluation paths:

- **In-loop training evals**: [`train_lm`][marin.experiment.train.train_lm] runs periodic multiple-choice evaluations through Levanter's lm-evaluation-harness integration and logs to W&B when an `EvalSuite` is provided.
- **Post-hoc evals**: the shared launcher or composable `EvalGroup`s evaluate multiple-choice and
  generation tasks with the Evalchemy fork.
- **Harbor tasks**: the shared launcher runs containerized agent benchmarks and registry datasets
  through Marin's Harbor integration.

## Post-hoc evaluation (evalchemy over a served endpoint)

A post-hoc eval is decoupled from the model backend by an OpenAI-compatible URL. `EvalGroup` uses
`EvalchemyExecutionMode.AUTO` by default: it starts inference and the Evalchemy client on the current
host outside Iris, and submits them through Iris from an Iris job. `LOCAL` and `IRIS` select either
mode explicitly. The group runner tears inference down after Evalchemy finishes.
Multiple-choice tasks use the served backend's logprob API, so they run the same way as generation —
no separate JAX-logprob backend.

The lifecycle and the evaluator are separate APIs:

```python
with local_inference(inference.model, inference.engine) as session:
    run_local_evalchemy(session.model, eval_config, output_path, env_vars=env)

with remote_inference(inference) as session:
    run_evalchemy(session.model, eval_config, output_path, env_vars=env)
```

`local_inference` owns the current-host server lifecycle. `remote_inference` also owns Iris link
registration. Endpoint-oriented mechanisms such as `run_local_evalchemy`, `run_evalchemy`,
`run_lm_eval`, and `run_harbor` own their native task and result contracts.

- [`eval_step`][marin.experiment.evaluation.eval_step] builds one post-hoc eval artifact from an
  `EvalGroup`; combine groups and aggregate them with
  [`eval_report`][marin.experiment.evaluation.eval_report]. Concrete task menus remain in
  `experiments/evals/evals.py`. See [Running Evaluations with Marin](../tutorials/run-lm-evals.md).

One `EvalGroup` (a task set) becomes one `EvalchemyResult` artifact addressed by
`evaluation/evalchemy/{model}/{group_id}`, so a pipeline picks up exactly the evals it needs and each
is cached and reused. The in-loop `EvalSuite` and the post-hoc `EvalGroup`s draw from the same task
menu.

### Task sets

Task sets are configured in [`task_configs.py`](https://github.com/marin-community/marin/blob/main/experiments/evals/task_configs.py).

- `CORE_TASKS` is the default for in-loop and post-hoc multiple-choice evals.
- `CORE_TASKS_PLUS_MMLU` extends `CORE_TASKS` with MMLU.
- Named menus (`core_evals`, `key_evals`, `base_model_evals`) bundle task sets into `EvalGroup`s; you can also define custom task lists in `task_configs.py` and pass them to your own `EvalGroup`s.

### In-loop metrics

Beyond task accuracy, the in-loop Levanter evaluator tracks these multiple-choice metrics:

1. **Bits per byte (`bpb`)**: `bpb = -log_prob / byte_length * ln(2)`
2. **Log probability (`logprob`)**: raw log probability of the correct answer.
3. **Choice log probability (`choice_logprob`)**: `log_prob_correct - log(sum(exp(log_prob_i)))`
4. **Length-normalized choice probability (`choice_prob_norm`)**:
   `exp(log_prob_correct / (byte_length_correct * ln(2))) / sum(exp(log_prob_i / (byte_length_i * ln(2))))`

## Generation tasks

Generation tasks (for example HumanEval, GSM8K, and MATH) run through the same post-hoc evalchemy
path as multiple-choice tasks: the served endpoint answers completion requests, and evalchemy scores
them.

- Task and suite definitions are in [`task_configs.py`](https://github.com/marin-community/marin/blob/main/experiments/evals/task_configs.py).
- A common entrypoint is [`run_key_evals.py`](https://github.com/marin-community/marin/blob/main/experiments/evals/run_key_evals.py).

## Harbor-based evaluation

Agentic launcher runs pass the same `RunningModel` boundary to
`run_harbor`. Off-cluster sandboxes receive a scoped capability route resolved by the inference
session.

- Harbor supports agent-style benchmarks such as AIME, Terminal-Bench, SWE-bench Verified, and other registry datasets.
- Marin's Harbor integration supports local Docker and hosted environments such as Daytona, E2B, and Modal.
- Setup, examples, and environment requirements are documented in [Harbor Framework Integration](../harbor-integration.md).
